# website-replica
Project: IITM Website Replica  This repository contains a clone of the IIT Madras BS Degree homepage. I built this to strengthen my CSS layout skills, specifically focusing on:  CSS Flexbox for navigation and alignment.  CSS Grid for complex content sections.  Media Queries to ensure the site looks great on all devices.
